## 2025-06-03 Automation Problem Resolution Log

### Summary

On June 3, 2025, the following issues were identified and resolved in the
xepoctpat/xepoctpat repository:

#### Problems Resolved

1. **YAML Syntax Errors in Workflows**

   - Removed invalid Markdown code block markers and stray comments from
     workflow files.
   - Ensured all workflow files start with valid YAML and use only spaces for
     indentation.

2. **dependabot-auto-merge.yml: Missing Required Input**

   - Fixed the workflow to use `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` for the
     pull-request-number input, removing the need for a separate step to fetch
     the PR number.

3. **metrics.yml: YAML Parsing Errors**

   - Removed all non-YAML content and ensured the file is pure YAML.
   - Confirmed correct indentation and structure for all steps and keys.

4. **General YAML Best Practices**

   - Ensured no tabs, only spaces for indentation.
   - All key-value pairs use a colon followed by a space.
   - No Markdown formatting (triple backticks) in YAML files.

5. **Validation**

   - Ran error checks on README.md, metrics.yml, and dependabot-auto-merge.yml.
     All files are now error-free.

6. **Action Documentation & Updates**

   - Reviewed the peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge action
     documentation for required and optional inputs.
   - Confirmed required inputs: `token` and `pull-request-number` are present
     in the workflow.
   - Confirmed `merge-method` is set to `squash` (recommended, but optional).
   - No new required inputs or breaking changes as of June 2025.
   - Will periodically check for action updates and document any future changes.

#### Next Steps

- Monitor GitHub Actions runs to ensure workflows execute as expected.
- If new errors appear, check for indentation, missing keys, or context-specific
  issues.
- Continue documenting all automation and error resolution steps in this log.
